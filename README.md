# Superheavies

Adds superheavy BattleMechs to Expanded Arsenal. Superheavies are 'Mechs exceeding 100 tons, featuring extremely heavy armor and devastating firepower.

In this mod, superheavy mechs are treated as something akin to "bosses": unique enemies that are particularly dangerous and hard to kill. As such, they cannot be met as randomly generated opponents. Instead, there are a number of special contracts, available at high skull ratings, that feature 1-2 superheavies as a key part of the opfor. Elite versions of these contracts are also available, featuring elite S-tier superheavies with upgraded gear.

These are the mechs included in the mod. All have X- and S-tier variants as well.

- Gigant SH-GG-O7 (135 tons)
- Longbow II SH-LGB-9 (120 tons)
- Matar II SAM-RS-MT2 (120 tons)
- Omega SHP-X4 (150 tons)
- Rampart RPT-1 (125 tons)
- Svarog SH-SVG-3A (125 tons)
- Terminus TMS-1 (135 tons)

In addition, this mod includes a 5-skull flashpoint that is unlocked after completing all the elite flashpoints in Elite Arsenal. Protect a world from the Word of Blake, duel a murderous Precentor, uncover a strange conspiracy... and loot a capstone mech as a reward for defeating the toughest opposition in the game!

## Implementation details

Some of the superheavies are (loosely) based on the same 'Mechs in canon, but most are original due to the scarcity of canon designs. Only conventional designs are implemented, ie those with 2 arms and 2 legs: no quads or tripods.

Superheavies have huge amounts of free tonnage, which allows them to mount even the heaviest weapons with ease. Rather than tonnage, they will usually be constrained by the number of free slots, which (because EA makes the minimum of changes to the base game) is the same as for normal 'Mechs. They also have the following advantages compared to normal mechs:

- \-5 recoil when firing ballistic weapons. The massive bulk of a superheavy makes it a stable firing platform.
- \-30% stability damage taken.
- \-50% crit chance when taking internal damage. The bulk of a superheavy also makes it robust against taking damage to its components.
- Twice the total hit points in the head compared to a normal mech: 41 points of internal structure, and 80 points of armor. You can still try for a headshot kill, but it'll take twice as long on average.

Superheavies have the following disadvantages:

- \-1 initiative penalty compared to assault mechs. Since the initiative track doesn't have room for a phase slower than assaults, this means that a superheavy moves in the same phase as an assault in the absence of initiative modifiers. However, the penalty becomes visible if you have any initiative bonuses: eg if you have a vanguard piloting a superheavy, they will still move in phase 1, rather than phase 2.
- \-1 penalty to melee attacks/defenses. Superheavies are clumsy and vulnerable in close combat.
- \-1 penalty to defense. Being big also means being easy to hit.
- _Unable_ to make use of jump jets, MASC or engine upgrades. The size and weight of a superheavy exceeds the limits of these technologies.
- _Unable_ to fit gyros of any kind.

In addition, there is a hard 400-ton limit on how much weight you can drop in any given mission. The Leopard can only carry so much.

## Prerequisites

This mod requires Elite Arsenal. It can be enabled and disabled at will; if you disable it, any superheavies in your inventory will remain functional but you won't meet any more until it is re-enabled.
