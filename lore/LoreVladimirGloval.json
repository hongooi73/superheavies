    "Details" : "Precentor Delta Vladimir Vladimirovich Gloval is a senior officer of the Manei Domini, the elite military organization of the Word of Blake. Left a paraplegic after being severely wounded at the Battle of Tukayyid, the Blakists fitted him with cybernetic implants that allowed him to regain full use of his body \u2014 while thoroughly indoctrinating him in the Word. Like all members of the Manei Domini, he is brutal, capricious, and utterly devoted to his cause.",
